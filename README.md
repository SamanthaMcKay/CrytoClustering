# CrytoClustering
------------
## Project Description

### Goal
Learn how to use unsupervised machine learning with KMeans, PCA, StandardScalar, and the Elbow method to evaluate crytocurrency data.

HVPlot
SKLearn

### Language
Python

### Software
VSCode
GitLens

## Code Explanation with Figures/Visualizations
## Standard Scalar and KMeans
-  Read in the cryto_market_data.csv and set the index to the column 'coin_id'.
-  Plotted the market data dataframe.
-  Used StandardScalar from scikit-learn to normalize the data.
-  Created a dataframe from the scaled data with the coin_id as the index.
-  Initiated a list with k values from 1 to 11, an empty list to hold the inertia values, a for loop to create a kmeans model, fit the scaled market data to the kmodel, and append the inertia from the kmodel to the inertia list.
-  Made a dataframe from the k-values and inertia list and plotted the kmeans elbow plot for the scaled market data.

-  The elbow plot indicated that the ideal number of clusters is either 4 or 5. I used 4 clusters.
-  Using KMeans, clustered the scaled market data with 4 predicted clusters and graphed the data in hvplot.

## Principle Component Analysis
- Performed principle component analysis with 3 components.
- Reduced the scaled market data to three components with fit_transform with a variance ratio of 89%.
- Converted the PCA information to a dataframe with coin_id as the index.
- Found the best value for k using the same method as above with the for loop.
- Used the k value and inertia information to graph the PCA elbow plot.

- The PCA elbow plot clearly shows the ideal number of clusters to be 4.
- Predicted the market data clusters with the PCA cluster information with 4 clusters.
- Graphed the first two features of the PCA dataframe with the cluster designations.

-  A comparison plot shows that the PCA elbow plot most clearly shows the ideal number of clusters to be four.

## Conclusion
Principle component analysis is a strong tool to simplify data to make prediction models execute faster. I am interested to apply this to real time data.
